# üï∏Ô∏ècli-status
cli-status is a Python command line app to get the ping, packet loss, and HTTP response code of a host in the terminal.

### Notes
- Uses the **rich** module for generating the table and the color coding in the terminal
- Updates **dynamically**; get updates in real time
- Choose everything: the ping timeouts, intervals, and packets, as well as the cooldown
- Color coded latency, packet loss, and HTTP response codes

### Instructions

1) You can do one of the following:

- Add hosts to a file line by line, excluding the http:// or https:// at the beginning
  #### hosts.txt
  ```
  google.com
  1.1.1.1
  8.8.8.8
  ```

 - Or, specify the hosts you would like to ping in your command line argument using -s

2) Run the script in your terminal
```
python main.py -f {FILE}.txt
```
or
```
python main.py -s cloudflare.com google.com 1.1.1.1
```

3) Wait for the table to generate; at the end, you should see a table with the ping and other stats

### Arguments

### Either one of these arguments are required
**-f** or **--file** - The path to the hostname file
**-s** or **--server** - Names of the servers to monitor (space in between each server)

### Optional
**-c** or **--count** - The number of packets to send
**-i** or **-interval** - The interval between each packet being sent - keep this low (0.1)
**-t** or **--timeout** - The maximum timeout for one packet (1000ms = 1000)
**-d** or **--cooldown** - The cooldown between every update
